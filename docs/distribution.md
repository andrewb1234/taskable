# Mouvadah distribution

Mouvadah Community is a self-hosted human-agent control and memory plane. The
current release stage is alpha. Version `0.1.1` is available as a checksummed
GitHub Release, a Homebrew-installed release command, and a separately
installable Python MCP bridge.

## Editions and licenses

| Offering | Description | License or terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mouvadah Community | Complete self-hosted API and web application | AGPL-3.0-only |
| Mouvadah MCP | Connector for local and hosted agent harnesses | Apache-2.0 |
| Mouvadah Cloud | Operated hosting, upgrades, backups, integrations, and support | Service terms when available |

The repository’s root [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) applies to the API, web
application, deployment materials, and other files unless a file says
otherwise. The contents of [`mcp/`](../mcp/) use the separate
[`mcp/LICENSE`](../mcp/LICENSE). The software licenses grant copyright
permissions, not rights to Mouvadah branding; see
[`TRADEMARKS.md`](../TRADEMARKS.md).

## Install the packaged Community release

The full application requires Docker with Compose v2:

```bash
brew install andrewb1234/tap/mouvadah
mouvadah install --email you@example.com --name "Your Name"
```

The same `mouvadah` command is available as a checksummed asset on the
[`v0.1.1` GitHub Release](https://github.com/andrewb1234/mouvadah/releases/tag/v0.1.1).
It downloads a checksummed Compose manifest and versioned API/web images, binds
both services to loopback, and preserves data on uninstall.

The MCP bridge is published independently:

```bash
pipx install mouvadah-mcp==0.1.1
```

## Install from source

The supported alpha path requires Python 3.12 or newer and Node.js 20 or
newer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewb1234/mouvadah.git
cd mouvadah
python3 bootstrap.py
```

The bootstrap creates an isolated environment, applies migrations, provisions
a local owner and API key, and prints commands for starting the API, web
application, and MCP bridge. See the repository [`README`](../README.md) for
the full local and Docker workflows.

## Packaged release contents

Each version tag builds:

- the `mouvadah-mcp` wheel and source archive;
- a local installer and Docker Compose manifest;
- multi-architecture (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`) API and web container
  images, referenced by immutable digest in the published Compose manifest;
- license, trademark, and third-party notices; and
- SHA-256 checksums, SBOMs, and build-provenance attestations.

`npx` is not a primary channel because the connector is Python and the
application is a multi-container service.

## Retraction

Published open-source copies cannot be recalled. A release or container tag
can be removed from its original channel, and a Python release can be yanked,
but existing downloads and valid license grants remain. Security or packaging
problems are corrected with a documented advisory and a new version rather
than silently replacing an immutable release.

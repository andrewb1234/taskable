# Mouvadah — shared control and memory for humans and coding agents

Mouvadah gives a software team and its agents one durable place for project
knowledge, dependency-aware work, claims, handoffs, and review. Humans use the
web interface; agents use the same state through a local
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) bridge.

**Current status:** Mouvadah is an alpha. You can evaluate the hosted
application at [mouvadah.com](https://mouvadah.com), install Mouvadah Community
`v0.1.1`, or run it from source. The hosted application does not yet carry
production availability, recovery, security-assessment, or support guarantees.

## What Mouvadah does

- Preserves project knowledge across short-lived agent sessions.
- Makes ticket dependencies, readiness, ownership, and blockers explicit.
- Prevents duplicate agent work with atomic claims, leases, and recovery.
- Keeps human and agent activity in one reviewable workflow.
- Connects local agent harnesses through a vendor-neutral MCP server.

## Install without cloning

The packaged Community installation requires Docker with Compose v2. On macOS
or Linux, install the release command with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install andrewb1234/tap/mouvadah
mouvadah install --email you@example.com --name "Your Name"
```

Or download and verify the release command directly:

```bash
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/andrewb1234/mouvadah/releases/download/v0.1.1/mouvadah
curl -fsSLO https://github.com/andrewb1234/mouvadah/releases/download/v0.1.1/SHA256SUMS
grep '  mouvadah$' SHA256SUMS | shasum -a 256 -c -
chmod +x mouvadah
./mouvadah install --email you@example.com --name "Your Name"
```

The command downloads the checksummed Compose manifest, binds the UI and API
to loopback, creates an authenticated local owner, and preserves its data when
you run `mouvadah uninstall`.

If you only need the agent bridge, install the independently licensed Python
package:

```bash
pipx install mouvadah-mcp==0.1.1
```

## Develop from source

The commands below are the recommended macOS/Linux development path.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.12 or newer
- Node.js 20 or newer with `npm`

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewb1234/mouvadah.git
cd mouvadah
python3 bootstrap.py
```

The interactive bootstrap asks for a local display name and email, then
installs the pinned dependencies and creates an authenticated local owner. It
does not start the application.

<details>
<summary>Files and settings created by bootstrap</summary>

- `.venv/` for the API and MCP Python dependencies
- `web/node_modules/` from the committed npm lockfile
- `.env` with a generated local JWT secret and loopback-only authentication
- `~/.taskable/taskable.db` for the local SQLite database
- `~/.config/mouvadah/credentials.env` for the revocable local API key
- a `mouvadah` entry in the Windsurf MCP configuration, when Windsurf is
  detected

The configuration and credential files are written with owner-only permissions
on the verified macOS/Linux path. Re-running bootstrap reuses the local owner
and active bootstrap key.

</details>

### 2. Start

Start the API in one terminal:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Start the web interface in a second terminal:

```bash
cd web
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). On the local sign-in
screen:

1. Copy the `MOUVADAH_API_KEY` value from
   `~/.config/mouvadah/credentials.env`.
2. Paste it into **Local API key**.
3. Choose **Continue locally**.

The API runs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000), and its OpenAPI
explorer is at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
Press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal to stop the servers.

### 3. Connect an agent

If bootstrap detected Windsurf, restart Windsurf and invoke the Mouvadah
`get_all_projects` tool.

For another MCP client, adapt [`mcp/mcp.json.example`](./mcp/mcp.json.example).
The installed local command is `.venv/bin/mouvadah-mcp`; it reads the API key
from the credentials file instead of embedding the secret in client JSON.
The MCP bridge uses `stdio` and opens no listening port.

See [`mcp/README.md`](./mcp/README.md) for standalone `pipx` and `uv` tool
installation options.

## Other ways to run

| Path | Availability | Use it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source + local dev servers | Supported alpha path | You are evaluating or developing Mouvadah locally. |
| Docker Compose from source | Supported alpha path | You want the API and web application in containers. |
| GitHub Release installer | Published for `v0.1.1` | Install the full local application without cloning. |
| PyPI | Published as `mouvadah-mcp` | Install only the MCP bridge for an agent harness. |
| Homebrew | Published through `andrewb1234/tap` | Install and update the full-application release command. |
| Hosted alpha | Available at [mouvadah.com](https://mouvadah.com) | Evaluate the product without treating it as a production service. |

To run the application containers after completing bootstrap:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The Compose profile
binds both published ports to loopback, reuses the local owner and SQLite
database, and keeps the MCP server on the host. Stop it with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
```

Distribution plans, licensing boundaries, and release retraction limits are in
[`docs/distribution.md`](./docs/distribution.md).

## The core model

```text
Workspace
├── Projects
│   ├── Knowledge tree (evidence → summaries → PRD/TDD)
│   └── Subprojects
│       └── Tickets (dependencies → claim → work → review)
└── Members and scoped API keys
```

Knowledge sits upstream of work: humans and agents curate durable context,
derive project plans, and then execute dependency-aware tickets. Claims and
leases coordinate concurrent workers; comments, audit events, source
references, and handoffs preserve how the result was reached.

## Architecture

```text
React web UI ── REST + SSE ── FastAPI + SQLModel ── SQLite (local)
                                  │
MCP client ── stdio bridge ── bearer-authenticated REST
                                  │
                            PostgreSQL (hosted profile)
```

- `web/` contains the Vite/React interface.
- `api/` contains the FastAPI application, authorization, migrations, and
  tests.
- `mcp/` contains the independently installable Python MCP bridge.
- `docker/` contains the local and release container profiles.

SQLite is the default local database. PostgreSQL deployments use Alembic
migrations and direct `LISTEN/NOTIFY` for cross-process realtime
invalidations.

## Security and maturity boundary

Local mode remains authenticated: bootstrap creates a real owner, an HttpOnly
browser session, and a revocable per-user API key. Project data is
workspace-scoped, and API keys may be limited by workspace, read, write, and
separate delete scopes, project, expiry, and revocation.

Mouvadah is still an alpha and must not be represented as a production-ready
public SaaS. The repository has verified application-layer tenant checks,
session revocation, exact-Origin protection for cookie writes, migration
checks, encrypted backup/restore tooling, security headers, CI, CodeQL, and
supply-chain checks. Published release manifests pin container images by
digest; runtime dependencies and base images are locked; and release images run
without root privileges. Production backup-provider configuration, recurring
restore evidence, distributed abuse controls, hosted failover evidence,
artifact signing, and independent security assessment remain release gates.

Read [`docs/security_and_trust.md`](./docs/security_and_trust.md) before any
hosted deployment. Operator configuration is documented in
[`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md),
[`docs/migrations.md`](./docs/migrations.md),
[`docs/recovery.md`](./docs/recovery.md), and
[`docs/incident_response.md`](./docs/incident_response.md).

## Develop and test

Run bootstrap once before using these commands:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest api/tests/ -v  # backend and MCP test suite
cd web && npm run build                   # TypeScript + production web build
cd web && npm run test:e2e                # authenticated Chromium tests
.venv/bin/python scripts/seed_demo.py     # add local demonstration data
```

The `Makefile` provides `make dev`, `make test`, `make build-web`, `make e2e`,
`make seed`, and `make docker` as optional shortcuts.

CI verifies Python 3.12 and 3.14, the frontend build, package and container
assembly, PostgreSQL migrations and recovery, authenticated realtime browser
behavior, dependency and secret scanning, and CodeQL.
